# Goataxx

Ataxx is an abstract strategy board game that involves play by two parties on a seven-by-seven square grid. The object of the game is for the player to make pieces constitute a majority of the pieces on the board at the end of the game, by converting as many of their opponent's pieces as possible.

Ataxx gameplay
Each player begins with two pieces, red and blue, for the first player and second player respectively. The game starts with the four pieces on the four corners of the board, with red in the top left and bottom right and blue on the other two. Red moves first.
During their turn, players move one of their pieces either one or two spaces in any direction. Diagonal distances are equivalent to orthogonal distances, i.e. it is legal to move to a square whose relative position is two squares away both vertically and horizontally. If the destination is adjacent to the source, a new piece is created on the empty departure square. Otherwise the piece on the source moves to the destination. After the move, all of the opponent player's pieces adjacent to the destination square are converted to the color of the moving player. Players must move unless no legal move is possible, in which case they must pass.
The board configuration may be altered by having certain squares filled (not playable by either player), or using different board sizes.
The game ends when all squares have been filled or one of the players has no remaining pieces. The player with the most pieces wins. A draw may occur when the number of squares is even, either from non-playable squares or nonstandard sizes having an even number of squares. Some versions also implement the threefold repetition rule from chess.

There are 2 mods in the game: playing with AI or playing against another player (so far implemented only from the same device).
At the beginning of the game, you must enter the path to the StreamingAssets folder in order to load csv tables with data for loading game fields and other data.
